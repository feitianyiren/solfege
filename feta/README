The pixmaps used to display music is generated from the feta font
used by GNU Lilypond, copyright Han-Wen Nienhuys, Jan Nieuwenhuizen
and others. Lilypond is the GNU project music typesetter, if you
want high quality music typesetting, check it out at
`http://www.lilypond.org'. Only the generated pixmaps for the font
are included in GNU Solfege, you should check the source tarball
for GNU Lilypond for the source code. This because GNU Solfege
only use a few of the fonts and I had to to some manual tweaking
to use the fonts. I got permission to do this from Han-Wen
Nienhuys.
