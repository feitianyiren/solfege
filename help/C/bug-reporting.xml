<para>Please make your bug reports detailed. ''I get an error message in a
window when I try to start the program.'' is not usable to me. When reporting
bugs:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Tell me what version of Solfege you run. Please check if a newer release is available. If you only want to run stable releases, then you don't have to test newer development releases.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>What operating system are you running? Version?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Describe exactly what you are doing when the error happens.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Send an exact copy of the error messages. They make sense to the Solfege author even if you think they look cryptic to you.</para></listitem>
