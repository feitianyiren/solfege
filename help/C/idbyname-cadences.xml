 As acknowledged in <ulink url="http://bugs.solfege.org/5">bug #5</ulink>
 we need cadence exercises in Solfege.

 In this release of Solfege, we only have one exercise with cadences
 in major. In this exercise, a major scale is played to establish the tonic.
 Maybe this is too little? Do we need a complete I-IV-V-I before the
 question? Or maybe it is better to write real music that ends in the
 cadence we want to practise?
 This are things we need to decide before we release 3.12.0.
