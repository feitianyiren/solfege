<para>The program play a randomly generated rhythm, and the user should
reproduce the rhythm. The user enters the rhythm by clicking on buttons
representing different rhythmic elements.</para>

<para>When you have entered enough rhythm elements, Solfege will check your
answer. If everything is correct is will display a happy face, otherwise
a sad face, and all wrong rhythms will be marked.</para>

<para>If some of your answer was wrong, everything from the first wrong
element will be removed (preserving any correct rhythms in the beginning
of your answer) when you click on the sad face, or when you click on the
rhythm buttons on top of the page.</para>

<para>You can click the 'Play' button to hear your suggestion.</para>

<para>The questions made by this exercise are at the moment made by
selecting rhythm elements randomly. This is not the best way to do it, and
we hope a more clever way of generating questions will be made in a later
release.</para>
