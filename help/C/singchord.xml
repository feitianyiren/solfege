<para>If you are conducting a choir, you have to sing the starting tones for
the different voices, and if you don't have a piano near by, you have to use a
tuning fork. If you are a male, you will sing the tones for the women, one
octave deeper, and visa versa.</para>

<para>The program will play the tone A (440 hz) for you, and display a chord
that you must sing. Solfege does not yet have support for microphone, so you
will have to decide yourself if your answer is correct or not. </para>
