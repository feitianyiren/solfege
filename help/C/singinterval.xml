<para>In this exercise, Solfege will display one or more intervals, and you should sing them. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to sing into a microphone and let Solfege decide if you sing correct, so you have to decide yourself if you are correct or wrong.</para>

<title>Config</title>
<para>The program will try to make a question where all tones are within the range the user can sing, as configured in the <link linkend='preferences-window'>preferences window</link>. Sometimes, it is not possible to keep the question within this range, for example when the exercise is configured to create many intervals where all intervals go upwards.</para>
