<para>In this exercise, the program will display all the twelve tones in the
scale in a random order and play the first one. Then you should sing all the
notes and see if the last note matches. So this is more like an exam in sight
singing than an exercise for learning how to sing the intervals. For that you
should try some of the other interval exercises.</para>
