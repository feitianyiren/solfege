@section The window title does not display non-ascii characters
... everything look like: "Solfege \x@{0414@}\x@{0438@}\x@{0442@}..."

This is because your window manager does not display unicode fonts.
Try a window manager that can handle unicode fonts, for example metacity.

@section The program crashes at startup!
Try to start the program with the @option{--no-sound}. If the
program starts, then you probably has to check the sound setup
for your kernel. If you for example have a Soundblaster 32 and
unloads the @file{awe_wave} module, Solfege will crash when it tries
to open @file{/dev/music}.

@section ValueError: invalid literal for float():
If you want translated messages, you should only set the @env{LC_MESSAGES}
environment variable, not @env{LC_ALL} or @env{LC_NUMERIC}. If your
window manager set these variable, you can avoid the problem by running
solfege like this:

@command{LC_NUMERIC=C solfege}

You can run the @command{locale} command to see what environment
variables controlling locales are set.

@section Some menu entries are blank when I use language other than english.
If you are running Debian with glibc > 2.2, try to rerun
@command{locale-gen} as root, and maybe edit @file{/etc/locale.gen}.

@section I get a lame piano sound in the rhythm exercise!
From the preferences window, on the config page, change the number
in the spin button, and click 'Apply'. Some sound cards have several
synths, and not all behave the same. For example, on a SB Live using
ALSA I had to select number 2.

Also if you use the standard OSS sound driver and @file{/dev/sequencer}
instead of  @file{/dev/music} you might be missing the percussion sounds.

@bye
